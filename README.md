# Topic Summary:
“Google’s AI Shift: Innovation or Overreach?” reports on Google’s controversial removal of the “100 results per page” search option as part of its broader move toward AI-driven systems like Gemini. While Google defends the change as a step toward faster, safer, and more sustainable search experiences, critics — especially small business owners — argue it limits transparency and online visibility. The segment highlights the growing divide between innovation and accessibility, asking whether Google’s AI evolution represents progress or a tightening grip on the digital world.
