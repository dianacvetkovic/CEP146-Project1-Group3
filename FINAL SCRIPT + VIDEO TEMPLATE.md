Good evening, and welcome to TechWatch.  
Tonight’s top story: Google is shaking up the internet again — but not everyone’s happy about it.   
The company recently made changes to how search results are displayed, removing the long-standing “100 results per page” option — 
and it’s all part of a bigger shift toward artificial intelligence.   
Supporters say it’s about innovation and efficiency.   
Critics call it a power grab that hurts small businesses and transparency.   
Our reporter, Diana, has more.

**Diana:**
Thanks, David.   
I’m here outside Google’s Toronto office, where reactions to these changes are mixed.   
On one hand, Google’s Gemini AI system is being praised for transforming how developers and educators use technology.   
On the other — business owners and SEO professionals say Google’s new limits could make it harder for them to compete online.  
I spoke with a Google representative earlier today.

*(Confident, positive tone)*

**Cole:**
At Google, our goal is to make information access faster, safer, and more relevant.   
By removing the 100-results-per-page feature, we’re improving efficiency, reducing data scraping by AI bots, and ensuring real human engagement drives our search results.  
Our AI model, Gemini, is helping millions of people — from coders using Gemini Code Assist to teachers personalizing learning for students.   
In software alone, productivity has risen by over 80%.   
We’re also cutting energy use per AI prompt by 33 times compared to last year.   
This is about responsible innovation — not restriction.

**Diana:**
But not everyone sees it that way.   
I also spoke to a small business owner who says these changes come at a cost.

**BUSINESS OWNER (1:30–2:00)** ***- Daud***

*(Concerned, frustrated tone)*

**Daud:**
Before this update, my company could track where we ranked across 100 results.  
Now, we only see the top 10.   
That means we’ve lost visibility — and potential customers.   
Google says it’s fighting bots, but for small businesses, it feels like we’re the ones paying the price.   
The web’s supposed to be open, but it’s starting to feel filtered — by AI.

**Diana:**
A clear divide — innovation versus accessibility.  
Back to you, David.

**David:**
Thanks, Diana.  
As Google continues its transformation into an AI-first company, the debate grows louder:   
Is this the next evolution of technology, or the start of a more controlled web?   
For now, one thing’s certain — the way we find and share information online is changing faster than ever.  
This has been TechWatch. I’m David,— stay informed, stay curious.
