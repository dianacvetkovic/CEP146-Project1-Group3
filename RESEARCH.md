## ImCaffeinated's Reasearch

### Gemini is Google’s family of advanced AI models, designed to handle tasks across text, code, images, and more. In software development, its most notable tools are:
- Gemini Code Assist: An AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write, debug, and optimize code.
- Gemini CLI: A command-line interface tool that brings Gemini’s capabilities directly into developer environments.
- These tools are part of Google’s push toward “agentic programming,” where AI agents actively assist in reasoning, compiling, testing, and even calling external tools during development.


### According to Google’s 2025 DORA report and recent research:
- Widespread Adoption: Over 90% of developers now use AI in their workflows, with many spending 2+ hours daily working alongside AI tools.
- Productivity Gains: 80%+ of developers report increased productivity thanks to AI assistance.
- Improved Code Quality: 59% say AI has positively impacted the quality of their code.
- Trust Paradox: While many developers rely on AI, only 24% report high trust in its outputs—suggesting it’s seen as a helpful tool, not a full replacement.


### Google recommends a four-phase framework for integrating Gemini Code Assist into teams:
- Adoption: Track usage metrics like daily active use and code suggestions.
- Trust: Measure how often developers accept AI-generated code.
- Acceleration: Use productivity metrics (e.g., story points, ticket closures) to assess speed improvements.
- Impact: Link improvements to business outcomes like time-to-market or revenue.


### Gemini is designed to be multimodal and deeply integrated into developer workflows. Here’s how it’s transforming coding:
- Context-aware coding: Gemini can understand entire codebases, not just snippets. This allows it to suggest changes, refactor code, and even explain logic across multiple files.
- Natural language interaction: Developers can ask questions like “Why is this function slow?” or “How do I optimize this loop?” and get meaningful answers.
- Tool integration: Gemini works inside IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains, and connects with Google Cloud, enabling AI-assisted DevOps, debugging, and deployment.

### Gemini Code Assist is Google’s flagship developer tool powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro. It’s used for:
- Code generation: Writing boilerplate, scaffolding, and even full functions based on natural language prompts.
- Bug fixing: Identifying and resolving errors, often faster than manual debugging.
- Test creation: Automatically generating unit tests and integration tests.
- Documentation: Writing or updating docstrings and README files.
- It’s available in Google Cloud and supports over 20 programming languages.


### Summary type document
Google’s Gemini AI is revolutionizing software development by acting as a highly capable coding assistant. The Gemini 2.5 Pro model powers Gemini Code Assist, which integrates directly into developer tools like VS Code and JetBrains, and supports over 20 programming languages. It helps developers write, debug, and optimize code, generate documentation, and even create tests.
The article highlights that Gemini is part of a broader shift toward agentic programming, where AI agents can reason through tasks, compile code, run tests, and interact with external systems. This marks a significant evolution from simple autocomplete tools to full-fledged AI collaborators.
According to Google’s 2025 DORA report, over 90% of developers now use AI tools regularly, with more than 80% reporting increased productivity. However, only 24% express high trust in AI-generated code, showing that while AI is widely adopted, developers still rely on their judgment.
To measure Gemini’s effectiveness, Google recommends a four-phase framework: adoption (usage metrics), trust (acceptance rates), acceleration (productivity gains), and impact (business outcomes). This structured approach helps teams evaluate how AI tools like Gemini are transforming their workflows.

In September 2025, Google DeepMind announced that its Gemini 2.5 Pro model achieved gold-level performance at the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals Challenge, a benchmark known for testing elite algorithmic problem-solving. Gemini solved solvable problems faster than 90% of human teams, placing it in the top tier of global competitors.
This milestone demonstrates Gemini’s exceptional reasoning ability, long-context understanding, and capacity to tackle complex programming tasks — far beyond what models like GitHub Copilot or Claude have achieved publicly. While Copilot excels at code completion and Claude shows strong multi-step reasoning, Gemini’s performance on ICPC-style challenges proves it can handle real-world algorithmic complexity at a competitive level.
DeepMind emphasized that Gemini’s success reflects advances in memory, planning, and tool use, making it a powerful collaborator for developers and researchers tackling hard computational problems.

The Dev.to article by Avais Ley (2025) explores how developers can leverage Gemini AI to build smarter, more adaptive applications. Unlike traditional coding assistants, Gemini can act as a backend reasoning engine, dynamically generating decisions, content, or queries based on user input. The article emphasizes prompt engineering as a key UX strategy, allowing developers to shape AI outputs with precision. Gemini’s support for multi-turn interactions and context retention makes it ideal for chatbots and intelligent assistants, while its integration into real-time decision systems highlights its versatility beyond code generation. The piece also notes the importance of secure API design when deploying Gemini in production environments.

Google is undergoing a significant transformation from a company primarily focused on data and search to one centered around artificial intelligence. This shift is evident in its widespread deployment of generative AI across industries, products, and internal operations. According to Google Cloud’s report on 101+ real-world generative AI use cases, the company is building AI agents that go far beyond traditional search. These agents are designed to serve customers, employees, creatives, coders, data analysts, and security teams—embedding intelligence into every layer of enterprise activity.
Major global brands like Mercedes-Benz, UPS, and Samsung are using Google’s AI tools—such as Gemini, Vertex AI, and BigQuery—to power in-vehicle assistants, optimize logistics, and enhance consumer apps. Google’s AI infrastructure is now the foundation for digital transformation, with tools like AlloyDB and Kubernetes Engine supporting everything from predictive modeling to 3D digital twins. Internally, Google Workspace with Gemini is automating workflows for companies like Equifax and KPMG, replacing manual tasks with intelligent automation.
This evolution marks a shift in Google’s role: data is no longer the end product but the fuel for AI-driven insights and decisions. BigQuery and Document AI are used not just to store information but to train models and generate actionable intelligence. The rapid expansion of use cases—from 101 to over 600 in just one year—underscores Google’s pivot from organizing information to enabling intelligent action. AI is no longer a feature of Google’s future—it’s the foundation of its identity.

Google’s transition from a search-and-data company to an AI-first enterprise raises critical questions about sustainability and accountability. According to Google Cloud’s own blog, even a single Gemini AI text prompt consumes 0.24 watt-hours of energy, emits 0.03 grams of CO₂ equivalent, and uses 0.26 milliliters of water. While Google touts efficiency improvements—like a 33x drop in energy use per prompt over 12 months—these figures still represent a significant footprint when scaled to billions of daily queries. Moreover, the blog acknowledges that many public estimates understate the true cost by ignoring idle machines, CPU/RAM usage, and data center overhead.
Computerworld’s critique goes further, arguing that Google’s methodology omits key variables and lacks independent verification. The article points out that Google’s estimates exclude the full lifecycle impact of AI infrastructure, such as manufacturing emissions, hardware disposal, and the energy used during model training. This selective accounting creates a misleading picture of AI’s environmental toll and undermines claims of sustainability.
NPR’s investigation adds a sobering layer: AI is driving soaring emissions at both Google and Microsoft, making them major contributors to climate change. The report highlights how the rapid expansion of AI data centers—especially those relying on water-intensive cooling—exacerbates environmental stress in vulnerable regions. Despite Google’s efforts to replenish water and use carbon-free energy, the scale and speed of AI deployment are outpacing these mitigations.
These findings suggest that Google’s full-scale shift to AI tools may be premature and environmentally reckless. Unlike search and data services, which are relatively lightweight and well-optimized, generative AI demands massive computational resources. Abandoning search in favor of AI agents risks trading a low-impact, high-utility model for one that’s energy-hungry and opaque.
In short, while AI offers exciting possibilities, Google’s core competencies in search and structured data remain more sustainable, transparent, and globally accessible. A hybrid strategy—where AI augments rather than replaces traditional services—would better align with environmental responsibility and public trust.

Google’s full transition into AI development reflects a troubling trend in Big Tech—one that risks undermining public trust, democratic oversight, and the broader social contract.

Another source critiguing Google abandoning its core search and data services in favor of AI tool development, The Conversation article by Ben Wagner (2024) offers a sobering critique. Wagner argues that Google’s aggressive AI pivot is not just a technological shift—it’s part of a broader pattern in Big Tech where companies pursue disruptive innovation without sufficient public accountability. This includes opaque decision-making, limited regulatory oversight, and a growing disconnect between corporate priorities and societal needs.
The article warns that AI development at scale often sidelines ethical considerations, especially when driven by profit and competitive pressure. Google’s dominance in search once relied on transparency, accessibility, and public utility. In contrast, its AI tools—like Gemini and Vertex AI—are increasingly proprietary, resource-intensive, and less open to scrutiny. Wagner emphasizes that this shift risks concentrating power in fewer hands, reducing the diversity of voices and platforms that once defined the open web.
Moreover, the transition to AI-first infrastructure could erode democratic control over information systems. Search engines are governed by algorithms that can be audited and critiqued; AI agents, especially those trained on opaque datasets, are harder to interrogate. This makes it more difficult for users, researchers, and regulators to understand how decisions are made, what biases are embedded, and who benefits.
In short, Google’s full embrace of AI development may compromise its foundational role as a public-facing information steward. Instead of enhancing access and understanding, it risks creating closed systems that prioritize efficiency over equity, and innovation over inclusion. A more balanced approach—where AI augments rather than replaces search and data services—would better serve both technological progress and democratic values.

# Diana's Research:
# 1. TechWyse – “Google Drops the 100 Results per Page Setting” (Sept 26, 2025, by Ayushi Salvi)
## What Happened
  - Google quietly removed the setting that allowed 100 results per search page in mid-September 2025.
  - Previously, users could:
    - Change the results-per-page setting manually in Google preferences, or
    - Add “&num=100” at the end of a search URL to force 100 results.
  - Both methods stopped working abruptly, with Google only confirming that the feature would no longer be supported—no formal announcement was made.

## Why Google Removed It
  - To limit large-scale data scraping and LLM (Large Language Model) training:
    - The “100 results” option allowed bots and tools to collect huge portions of Google’s search index in one request.
    - Rank trackers and AI data harvesters benefited most, using this data for keyword tracking and machine learning.
    - Disabling it helps Google restrict access to bulk data and reduce competitive risks from AI companies.
  - To better align with real user behavior:
    - Research shows most users never scroll past page one of results.
    - Showing 100 results at once didn’t reflect genuine search engagement, so limiting results makes analytics more realistic.
  - To improve server performance and efficiency:
    - Fetching 100 results in a single query puts a heavier load on Google’s infrastructure.
    - Smaller batches spread requests more evenly, ensuring faster, more stable searches globally.

## Impact on Reporting Metrics
- Impressions in Search Console decreased because many came from bots, not real users.
- Average position improved for many websites since inflated low-ranking data was removed.
- Traffic numbers stayed stable — actual visits and clicks didn’t change, only how data is counted.

## SEO Reporting Changes
- The September 2025 shift means any sudden data changes (impressions or average rank) are not due to SEO strategy, but due to Google’s reporting cleanup.
- Marketers should now focus on meaningful metrics — clicks, leads, and conversions — instead of inflated impressions.
- This can actually benefit marketers, allowing them to concentrate on top-page rankings that drive real traffic.

## Effect on SEO Tools
- Rank tracking tools (SEMrush, Ahrefs, Moz, etc.) are directly impacted:
  - Each “100-result” query now splits into about 10 separate requests, raising costs and slowing down data collection.
  - Tools briefly failed to gather complete SERP data after the update, missing deep-page rankings.
  - Platforms are now reducing tracking depth, focusing mainly on the top 10–20 results where clicks occur.
  - The extra API load is likely to cause higher subscription prices or stricter plan limits for SEO tool users.

## The AI Connection
- Google likely made this move to control access to its search data as AI systems (like ChatGPT and others) depend on it for training.
- Limiting bulk scraping prevents outside companies from creating AI products using Google’s data.
- This aligns with Google’s broader strategy to push users toward its own AI-powered search features, such as AI overviews.

## What Marketers Should Do
- Add a clear note in analytics dashboards marking this change (mid-Sept 2025) to avoid confusion in future performance reviews.
- Focus less on impressions, more on customer actions (clicks, conversions).
- Concentrate SEO strategies on page-one visibility, since few users go deeper.
- Stay updated on how your SEO tools are adjusting to the change.
- Begin optimizing for AI visibility, ensuring your content appears in AI-generated search results and summaries.


# 2. Search Engine Land – “Google Search Confirms It Does Not Support the Results per Page Parameter” (Sept 18, 2025, by Barry Schwartz)
## What Changed
- Around Sept 10–12, 2025, Google disabled the “&num=100” URL parameter that allowed users to load 100 search results per page.
- Rank-checking tools immediately began showing errors, and Search Console data showed massive drops in impressions.
- Google later confirmed that the parameter was “not officially supported.”

## Google’s Statement and Background
- A Google spokesperson said the feature was never formally supported, implying its removal is intentional.
- Historically, Google allowed users to choose result numbers through Settings (until 2018). After that, only the URL trick worked—until now.
- When asked whether this was a bug, Google repeated that the feature isn’t supported, suggesting this was a permanent policy change.

## Possible Reasons for the Change
- Google did not specify reasons, but industry speculation suggests:
  - Preventing unauthorized scraping that violated Google’s Terms of Service.
  - Possibly restricting AI developers (like OpenAI) from using search data for model training.
- The move also appears to reduce inflated metrics in Search Console caused by bots.

## Effects on SEO and Tools
- Third-party rank tracking platforms relying on “&num=100” have had to reprogram their data collection systems.
- Many SEO dashboards now show lower impressions but higher average rankings, since irrelevant bot data is removed.
- Search Console’s datasets are expected to be more accurate, showing real human behavior rather than machine activity.

## Why It Matters
- If you relied on “&num=100,” that method is now obsolete — no workaround exists.
- SEO tools are issuing updates, but users should expect less data depth and more reliance on top-page results.
- Over time, marketers may notice more consistent but smaller-scale performance data.

# 3. Innovative Media – “Google Removed num=100: What It Means for Data, Search Visibility, and SEO” (Innovative Media Canada)
- Between late 2024 and early 2025, Google quietly disabled the “num=100” search parameter — previously used to display or scrape 100 results per page.
- The change affects SEO data transparency, search visibility, and AI data access across the web.

## What “num=100” Did
- Allowed marketers and analysts to view 100 results per page instead of 10.
- Essential for SEO tracking, keyword research, and web scraping.
- Removal now caps access to 10 results per query, severely limiting visibility beyond the first page.

## Impact on Search Visibility
1. Reduced Access to Indexed Pages:
- Researchers estimate that 80–90% of indexed pages are now hidden from large-scale analysis.
- Pages ranking between positions 20–100 are still indexed but less visible and rarely seen.
- Websites outside the top 10 now receive fewer referrals and impressions.
2. Effects on AI and Data Scraping:
- AI tools and SEO crawlers that used “num=100” to gather data now face slower, smaller data collection.
- This move likely aims to restrict external AI models from harvesting Google’s search data for training.
3. Transparency and Control:
- Google now holds greater control over what data marketers can access.
- Analysts must rely more on Google’s internal data tools (Search Console, Analytics).
- Critics say this reduces independent oversight of how Google ranks pages.

## Effects on SEO Strategy
- Visibility Shrinks for Lower Rankings:
  - Websites outside the top 10 are less discoverable.
  - SEO efforts should prioritize ranking in the top results where traffic is concentrated.
- Dependence on Google Tools Grows:
  - Businesses now must rely on Search Console and Google Analytics for insights.
- Shift Toward AI-Driven Search:
  - The change aligns with Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and AI-powered results.
  - Success depends on how well content appears in AI overviews, not just classic rankings.

## Impact on Marketing and Research
- Keyword research becomes less complete as SEO tools can’t access deep-page data.
- Market research is harder — niche competitors on later pages are less visible.
- Content strategy must adjust — long-tail keyword opportunities are harder to detect.

## Google’s Official Stance vs. Industry Interpretation
- Google says the change improves performance and server efficiency.
- Experts suspect it’s also designed to protect proprietary data and limit AI competition.
- Some professionals argue it makes the web less open and auditable.

## What Website Owners Should Do
- Strengthen on-page SEO with optimized metadata and headers.
- Improve user engagement signals (CTR, dwell time).
- Focus on high-quality, trustworthy content that fits AI ranking systems.
- Use Search Console data as the main performance metric source.

## The Future Outlook
- Google’s change signals a shift toward a smaller, AI-filtered web.
- Fewer results mean the internet appears more curated, with more control in Google’s hands.
- Businesses that adapt with quality content and AI-optimized strategies will remain visible.

# 4. The HOTH – “Why You Can’t See 100 Results on Google Anymore” (Sept 25, 2025, by Rachel Hernandez)
## What Changed
- Between Sept 10–12, 2025, Google disabled the “&num=100” parameter that allowed showing 100 results per page.
- This immediately disrupted rank-tracking tools (Ahrefs, Semrush, etc.), causing:
  - Missing or inaccurate keyword data beyond page 1.
  - Major impression losses (up to 87.7%) across Google Search Console data.
  - 77% of sites lost unique ranking keywords.

## Theories Behind Google’s Decision
1. Preventing Bulk Scraping:
- The parameter allowed any scraper to capture 100 results in one call — ideal for AI training data.
- Removing it limits how much data LLMs and scrapers can harvest at once.
2. Reducing Server Strain:
- Each 100-result request consumed far more computing power.
- Cutting it helps Google save energy and improve system efficiency.
3. Improving Data Accuracy:
- Since users rarely see 100 results, showing smaller batches creates more realistic analytics in Search Console.
4. Protecting Google’s AI Advantage:
- Google’s own AI search (powered by Gemini and AI Overviews) benefits when competitors have less access to raw data.

## Impact on SEO and Data Tools
- Each tool query now needs 10 separate page requests instead of one, raising infrastructure and subscription costs.
- Data freshness suffers — gathering results takes longer, leading to outdated or missing keyword data.
- Many dashboards currently display broken or incomplete tracking information.

## Positive Outcomes
- Although impressions dropped, Google Search Console data is now more accurate.
- Previously, bots inflated impressions for results ranked 11–100.
- With the change, metrics now better represent real user engagement.

## What SEO Professionals Should Do
- Remain patient as rank-tracking tools update their systems.
- Watch for price or feature changes in your SEO platforms.
- Shift focus toward new success indicators like:
  - Visibility in AI Overviews.
  - Brand mentions or citations in AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity.
  - Share of voice across AI-enhanced SERPs.
- Understand that organic blue-link rankings are no longer the sole measure of SEO success.
