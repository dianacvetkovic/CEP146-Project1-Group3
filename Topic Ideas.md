### Major cybersecurity breaches in 2025 and lessons learned (Ideas if we wanted to go this route)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Salt Typhoon Attacks on U.S. Telecom & Treasury
- 	What happened: A Chinese-linked group, Salt Typhoon, breached U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and infiltrated Treasury Department workstations.
- 	Impact: Disrupted services, exposed sensitive government communications, and triggered diplomatic sanctions.
- 	Lesson: Critical infrastructure must adopt zero-trust models and enhance endpoint security.

3. UNFI Food Supply Chain Disruption
- 	What happened: United Natural Foods Inc. was hit by a cyberattack that crippled its ordering systems.
- 	Impact: Grocery shortages across North America, affecting Whole Foods and other retailers.
- 	Lesson: Supply chains need robust disaster recovery plans and third-party risk assessments.

4. Sepah Bank Data Breach (Iran)
- 	What happened: Hacker group “Codebreakers” stole 42 million customer records from Bank Sepah.
- 	Impact: One of the largest financial data breaches ever, with ransom demands and leaked data.
- 	Lesson: Financial institutions must prioritize encryption, tokenization, and network segmentation.

5. TeleMessage Breach – U.S. Officials Exposed
- 	What happened: A compliance messaging app used by FEMA and CBP was compromised.
- 	Impact: Metadata of high-level officials leaked, raising counterintelligence concerns.
- 	Lesson: Secure communication tools must use end-to-end encryption and undergo rigorous vetting.

6. Microsoft SharePoint “ToolShell” Exploits
- 	What happened: Threat actors exploited vulnerabilities in on-prem SharePoint servers.
- 	Impact: Widespread compromise across sectors, with links to China-based attackers.
- 	Lesson: Timely patching and vulnerability management are non-negotiable in enterprise IT.

7. Scattered Spider & SafePay Ransomware Campaigns
- 	What happened: These groups targeted retail, aviation, and IT distribution giants like Ingram Micro.
- 	Impact: Disruption of operations during peak periods (e.g., July 4 holiday).
- 	Lesson: Ransomware defense must include behavioral detection, backups, and employee training.
